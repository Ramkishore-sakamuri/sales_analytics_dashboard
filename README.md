# sales_analytics_dashboard
## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ramkishore-sakamuri/sales_analytics_dashboard
    cd sales_analytics_dashboard
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have `pip` installed and updated.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You will need to create the `requirements.txt` file based on the libraries used, e.g., `pandas`, `dash`, `plotly`, `dash-bootstrap-components`)*

4.  **Configure Database:**
    * Navigate to the `config/` directory.
    * If you plan to connect to a database, copy `db_config.ini.template` to `db_config.ini` (if a template is provided) or create `db_config.ini`.
    * Update `db_config.ini` with your actual database credentials.
    * **IMPORTANT:** Ensure `db_config.ini` (if it contains real secrets) is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive information. Prefer using environment variables for production secrets.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare Data:**
    * The dashboard currently uses `data/sample_sales_data.csv`.
    * To use your own data, replace or update this file, or modify `src/data_loader.py` to point to your data source (e.g., a database, API, or other file formats). Ensure your data has a similar structure or update the processing logic accordingly.

2.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    Navigate to the `src/` directory and run the main application file:
    ```bash
    cd src
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically start a local development server. Open your web browser and go to the address provided in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`).

3.  **Explore Data (Optional):**
    To perform exploratory data analysis:
    * Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed (`pip install jupyterlab notebook`).
    * Navigate to the project's root directory.
    * Start Jupyter:
        ```bash
        jupyter lab
        # or
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    * Open the `notebooks/sales_data_exploration.ipynb` file and run the cells.

## Data

The project includes a `data/sample_sales_data.csv` file with the following example columns:
`OrderID,OrderDate,ProductCategory,ProductName,Quantity,UnitPrice,Salesperson,Region`

You will need to adapt the `data_loader.py` and potentially `data_processor.py` if your data schema differs significantly.

## Configuration

* **Database:** Database connection parameters can be configured in `config/db_config.ini`. The application will need to be updated to read from this file if database integration is implemented beyond the CSV loader.
* **Dashboard Settings:** Other application-specific settings might be found or added within `src/app.py` or dedicated configuration modules.

## Future Enhancements

* **User Authentication:** Secure the dashboard with user logins and roles.
* **Database Integration:** Robust connection to various SQL/NoSQL databases.
* **Advanced Filtering & Drill-Downs:** More sophisticated interactive filtering and the ability to drill down into data.
* **Export Options:** Allow users to export charts or data tables (e.g., to CSV, PDF).
* **Automated Reporting:** Schedule and send out regular sales reports.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Incorporate forecasting models for sales predictions.
* **Deployment:** Instructions for deploying to platforms like Heroku, AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
* **More KPIs:** Add a wider range of relevant sales and business KPIs.
* **Improved UI/UX:** Further enhancements to the user interface and experience.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:** Implement a comprehensive testing suite.
